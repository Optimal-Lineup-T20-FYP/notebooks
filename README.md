Project impact:

Designed a player rating mechanism to quantify a playerâ€™s contribution in Twenty20 cricket matches, and programmed
an integer optimization algorithm that enhanced team selection strategies by 53.63 percent.

Extracted, transformed, and analyzed the data of 651k balls across 2644 T20 matches to gain actionable insights.

Developed a Runs Above Average predictive machine learning model using linear regression to predict the outcome for
each ball based on the match situation and reduced prediction error by 54.55 percent compared to the baseline model.
